This repo contains a small Java project that flips coins. The file 'Main.java' executes a program 
that prompts the user with a set of actions.

The user may flip coins, view the results summary of the coin flips, check a particular coin, 
or quit the program. Beginning a new set of coin flips erases the results of the previous set.
